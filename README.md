# Türkmen Twitter Bot
This is a experimental Scala project. A twitter bot answering some commands such
as greetings, proses and proverbs in Turkmen language. 

Currently it responds only two commands,
```scala
@turkmenBot ! Salam
or
@turkmenBot ! Nakyl
```
Please do not forget the '!' between mention and command.

## TODO

I am very open to interesting suggestions, please do suggest! And if you are a
developer wanting to improve the code, please submit a PR.

Current suggestions,
  - [ ] Retweets some hashtags (#TürkmençeÝaz, #Düşüňýäňmi, wş), easier to
    implement.
  - [ ] Spell check turkmen words. Interesting but harder.
  - [ ] ...
